<summary><strong>Explaining Election Violence: A Meta-Analysis (2025)</strong> - <em>Journal of Peace Research</em></summary>

The literature on election violence lacks a consistent set of core predictors for why certain elections are violent and others are not. Between 2010 and 2022 ninety-seven scholars published sixty-five peer-reviewed journal articles on this topic using quantitative research designs involving over 440 predictor variables. As a distinct research area, therefore, the study of election violence has reached a size and maturity where it is useful to take stock. Through a meta-analysis of 581 models, this manuscript makes three key contributions. First, it finds that thirteen of forty-four variables consistently predict election violence, which highlights both the field's fragmentation and most promising avenues for future research. Second, it reveals that election-specific factors like fraud and competitiveness are more reliable predictors than commonly studied structural conditions like democracy or economic development. Third, it shows that many predictors operate differently at national and subnational levels, with only population size and domestic conflict significant at both levels. This manuscript’s findings suggest a greater focus is needed on election-specific triggers, explicit discussions about perpetrators and targets, and measurement issues.

<summary><strong>Correlates of Voter Turnout (2023)</strong> - <em>Political Behavior</em></summary>

_with Ferran Martínez i Coma_

Despite decades of research, there is no consensus as to the core correlates of national-level voter turnout. We argue that this is, in part, due to the lack of comprehensive, systematic empirical analysis. This paper conducts such an analysis. We identify forty-four articles on turnout from 1986 to 2017. These articles include over 127 potential predictors of voter turnout, and we collect data on seventy of these variables. Using extreme bounds analysis, we run over fifteen million regressions to determine which of these seventy variables are robustly associated with voter turnout in 579 elections in 80 democracies from 1945 to 2014. Overall, twenty-two variables are robustly associated with voter turnout, including compulsory voting, concurrent elections, competitive elections, inflation, previous turnout, and economic globalization.
