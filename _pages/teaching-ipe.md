## Class description

In 2025 and 2026 I co-teach this class with Dr. Ruosui "Kelly" Zhang. I teach weeks 1 and 7-12, and Dr. Zhang teaches weeks 2-6.

The study of International Political Economy (IPE) examines the interactions between markets and politics. Is globalisation responsible for the rise of populism in the West? How will the power struggle between China and the United States shape global business? This course introduces students to the key concepts and theories of IPE in order to analyse and understand these pressing issues and questions facing policymakers and citizens.

IPE is an interdisciplinary academic field within international relations which draws inputs from international politics and international economics to examine the dynamic linkages between markets, states and institutions, and civil society in the regional and global context. This course explores topics such as globalisation, international trade, finance, debt, foreign direct investment, development, international migration, and consequences and controversies of globalisation.
