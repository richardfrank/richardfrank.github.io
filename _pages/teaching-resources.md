## Resources
Over the years I have created a number of resources for my students and tutors including guides for writing literature reviews and research proposals. I have collected a number of these resources on my teaching resources page.

Finally, for an introductory course on international relations I used to teach I developed a semester-long simulation centered on the ongoing Syrian conflict. In 2017 I won a college teaching award for the simulation design, and I published an article with Dr. Jessica Genauer describing it in more detail. This article outlines the costs and benefits of simulation design options towards encouraging students’ understanding of international relations concepts, and it proposes a course plan for tightly integrating lectures, readings, assessment, and simulation, regardless of class size or length. You can find the paper at the journal here. If your institution does not subscript to PS and you are interested in a copy of this paper, do let me know. Finally, you may be interested to know that this simulation has been updated by later course conveners (Ben Goldsmith and Ernest Akuamoah) to focus on current Ukrainian/Russian war.

I have also uploaded all my slides from my 2012 graduate maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) class on the class page. They start with the intuition behind and assumptions underlying each type of model before giving hands-on examples. I found this approach very useful when I was learning these models, and I hope others find them useful as well. Please forgive the rather dated formatting of these slides!
